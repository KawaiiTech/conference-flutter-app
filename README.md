# DACFFest Flutter App

On Sunday 28 of October we[1] decided to build a little multiplatform conference app for DACHFest[2] 2018.

We decided to write it from scratch because we wanted:

1. Something simple and to the point (showing the schedule).
2. Something multiplatform (and that's why we used Flutter).
3. A fun weekend project for the two of us.

## FAQ

**Could you add...?**

No, we are not open for suggestions. Feel free to submit a PR, but we may or may not merge it.
We don't have time to maintain it.

**Is the app code correct?**

It was a weekend project. Meaning, there are some good practices that we ignored, for example
writing UI tests, implementing dependency injection, and following an architectural pattern.

i.e. don't take this project as a GOOD Flutter app example.

But it does what it is supposed to do :-)

**Can I fork the project and build my own conference app?**

Yes! The app is open source, so please follow the attached licenses.

Otherwise, if you can pay it, we can do it for you: http://beltran.work/with-me
